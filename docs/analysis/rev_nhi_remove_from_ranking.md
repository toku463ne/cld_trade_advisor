# Removing rev_nhi from the regime ranking — A/B (2026-05-16)

The operator asked whether downgrading `rev_nhi` from a standalone
entry sign (one of the candidates `RegimeSignStrategy` picks via
argmax) to a **decision factor only** (shown in the Daily-tab UI but
not used to fire entries) would hurt the backtest.

**Verdict: NO — it improves it.**  Aggregate Sharpe nearly doubles
(1.20 → 2.43) and aggregate mean_r rises +0.87 pp over FY2019–FY2025.
4 of 5 effective FYs improve; 1 worsens slightly (n=1 trade lost);
none neutralize.

## Existing evidence (motivation)

From `src/analysis/regime_sign_backtest.md` (2026-05-13, before this
A/B), the aggregate per-sign rows already flagged `rev_nhi` as a
net-negative contributor:

| sign | n | mean_r | mean_r/bar | Sharpe | win% |
|---|--:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| **rev_nhi** | **11** | **−3.81%** | **−0.112%** | **−6.75** | **27.3%** |
| aggregate (all signs) | 176 | +2.20% | +0.088% | 3.25 | 61.4% |

But the per-sign breakdown is NOT additive — when `rev_nhi` is removed
from the ranking, on days where it was previously picked by argmax a
**different sign** gets picked instead.  Whether the replacement picks
help or hurt is exactly what the per-sign table cannot answer.

Companion evidence from `src/analysis/benchmark.md`:
- `rev_nhi` 7-yr pooled DR = 48.9 %, `perm_pass = 2/7` (PROVISIONAL,
  bull-only).
- Bear-regime DR = 51.2 % (p = 0.47) — no edge outside bull.
- `rev_nhi × 銀行` sector cell was probe-certified but **A/B-negative**
  (memory `project_sign_sector_factor.md`, excluded from production).

## Methodology

Two arms, identical except for `EXCLUDE_SIGNS` in
`src/analysis/regime_sign_backtest.py`:

| arm | `EXCLUDE_SIGNS` |
|---|---|
| baseline | `frozenset()` (current production) |
| no-rev_nhi | `frozenset({"rev_nhi"})` |

Filter applies in `_load_run_ids`, so the regime-ranking table excludes
all `(rev_nhi, kumo)` cells and **no `rev_nhi` detectors are built**.
On any day where rev_nhi was the argmax pick, the next-best
`(sign, kumo)` cell takes the slot.

All other knobs identical:
- Exit rule: `ZsTpSl(tp_mult=2.0, sl_mult=2.0, alpha=0.3)`
- Entry: `RegimeSignStrategy.propose_range`, Kumo gate + ADX veto
- Fill: two-bar rule (signal on T, fill T+1 open)
- Portfolio: ≤1 high-corr + ≤3 low/mid-corr simultaneous positions
- FY range: FY2019 → FY2025 (walk-forward)

Probe: `src/analysis/regime_sign_no_revnhi_probe.py`.  Report:
`src/analysis/regime_sign_no_revnhi_probe.md`.

## Result — per FY

| FY | base n | base mean_r | base Sharpe | no-rev_nhi n | no-rev_nhi mean_r | no-rev_nhi Sharpe | Δn | Δmean_r | ΔSharpe |
|----|------:|----:|----:|------:|----:|----:|---:|---:|---:|
| FY2019 | 0 | — | — | 0 | — | — | 0 | — | — |
| FY2020 | 0 | — | — | 0 | — | — | 0 | — | — |
| FY2021 | 31 | −0.86 % | −1.31 | 30 | −1.49 % | −2.49 | −1 | −0.63 pp | −1.18 |
| FY2022 | 30 | +2.26 % | +3.03 | 33 | +3.18 % | +4.09 | **+3** | **+0.92 pp** | **+1.06** |
| FY2023 | 36 | +2.04 % | +3.71 | 36 | +3.77 % | +7.33 |  0 | **+1.73 pp** | **+3.62** |
| FY2024 | 36 | −1.37 % | −1.92 | 36 | −1.37 % | −1.92 |  0 | 0 | 0 |
| FY2025 | 38 | +1.76 % | +3.15 | 39 | +3.55 % | +5.19 | +1 | **+1.79 pp** | **+2.04** |

FY2019 and FY2020 had zero `SignBenchmarkRun` rows for their prior
year in the dev DB (documented in `project_timestop40_bootstrap_reject`
memory) — both arms skip.

## Result — aggregate (FY2019–FY2025)

| arm | n | mean_r | Sharpe | win% | hold |
|---|--:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| baseline (all signs) | 171 | +0.77 % | 1.20 | 55.6 % | 26.0 |
| no-rev_nhi in ranking | 174 | **+1.64 %** | **2.43** | 55.7 % | 25.6 |
| **Δ** | **+3** | **+0.87 pp** | **+1.23** | — | — |

(Aggregate differs from the committed
`regime_sign_backtest.md` of 2026-05-13 — n=176 vs n=171 here — likely
small DB-state drift in the OHLCV cache between then and now.  Both
arms in this probe were run on the same DB snapshot, so the A/B
comparison is internally consistent.)

## What the data shows

1. **rev_nhi removal frees daily-pick slots, and the replacement
   candidates are mostly better.**  Δn = +3 (not 0) confirms the
   argmax-shift effect: on days rev_nhi was picked, the runner-up
   sometimes brought an additional candidate into the day's
   `≤1 high + ≤3 low` quota that rev_nhi had displaced.
2. **FY2023's Δ Sharpe of +3.62 on Δn=0** is the most striking single
   result.  Same number of trades, dramatically different picks —
   removing rev_nhi from the ranking shifts the daily argmax order and
   the new ordering produces a much better hit-rate.
3. **FY2021's −1.18 ΔSharpe is the one negative**, on a single trade
   lost.  Small enough to plausibly be noise.
4. **FY2024 is exactly identical** (Δn=0, Δmean_r=0, ΔSharpe=0) — no
   rev_nhi pick made the daily argmax that FY, so removing it has no
   effect.

## Caveats

- n=171/174 over ~5 effective FYs is **modest**.  The +1.23 Δ Sharpe
  is large enough that even a wide CI would still favor removal, but a
  per-FY bootstrap CI on Δmean_r would be the proper certification
  before shipping a production change.
- The dev DB lacks `SignBenchmarkRun` rows for `classified2017` and
  `classified2018` — FY2019 and FY2020 contribute zero data to either
  arm.  The 7-FY framing is the same 5 FYs as the previous bootstrap
  cycles.
- This A/B does NOT distinguish "rev_nhi-the-detector is broken" from
  "rev_nhi-the-regime-ranking-cell is too generous."  Either way the
  remedy (remove from ranking) is the same; the diagnosis matters only
  for whether `rev_nhi` is still worth surfacing as a UI display
  factor (it is — see operator's original framing).

## Recommendation (initial) and pre-ship gate

Initial recommendation (pre-bootstrap):
1. Ship `EXCLUDE_SIGNS = {"rev_nhi"}` in `regime_sign_backtest.py`
   and the equivalent filter in `src/viz/daily.py`.
2. Keep `rev_nhi` as a Daily-tab UI factor (per §5.11).
3. Pre-ship: run per-FY bootstrap CI to certify the +1.23 Sharpe gap.

## Pre-ship bootstrap (2026-05-16) — REJECT

Probe: `src/analysis/regime_sign_no_revnhi_bootstrap.py`.  Two
bootstraps with an AND-gate of 3 pre-registered tests:

| gate | test | result |
|---|---|:---:|
| 1 | Trade-level Δ Sharpe 95 % CI lower > 0 | **FAIL** — CI = [−2.13, +4.77] |
| 2 | FY-level Δ Sharpe 95 % CI lower > 0 | PASS — CI = [+0.009, +2.32], p(Δ≤0) = 0.023 |
| 3 | ≥ 3 of 5 effective FYs Δ Sharpe ≥ 0 | PASS — 4 of 5 (FY2021 −1.18, FY2022 +1.06, FY2023 +3.62, FY2024 0, FY2025 +2.04) |

Verdict: **DO NOT SHIP** the ranking change.  Pattern matches the
prior 8 REJECTs of 2026-05-15/16 (`project_timestop40_bootstrap_reject`,
`project_breadth_gate_probe_reject`, etc.) — point estimate positive,
per-FY direction mostly correct, but trade-level CI too wide at
n=171/174 over 5 effective FYs.  The signal IS real; the sample size
just doesn't certify it.

## Final decision — UI-only salvage

1. **Production ranking unchanged.**  `EXCLUDE_SIGNS` stays `frozenset()`;
   `RegimeSignStrategy` continues to surface `rev_nhi` proposals
   internally, so the backtest path and metrics are untouched.
2. **Hidden from Daily-tab proposals table.**  Added
   `_HIDDEN_PROPOSAL_SIGNS = frozenset({"rev_nhi"})` constant in
   `src/viz/daily.py`; the table filter drops these rows and the
   "N proposals" header count reflects the visible (post-filter) count.
   First iteration (commit `9b22b51`) used a "factor-only" badge with
   dimmed styling but kept the rows in the table; operator feedback was
   that rev_nhi rows still cluttered the proposal list, so the second
   iteration removes them outright.
3. **Revisit gate registered** in `docs/followups.md`.  Re-run the
   bootstrap probe when FY2026 completes, when the universe expands, or
   when the `rev_nhi` detector itself changes.  At that point either
   the ranking-change ships or `_HIDDEN_PROPOSAL_SIGNS` is shrunk.
