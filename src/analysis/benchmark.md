# Sign Detector Benchmark Results

## Parameters

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Universe | classified2023 representatives (164 stocks) |
| Period | 2023-04-01 – 2025-03-31 (2 years, ~490 trading days) |
| Granularity | 1d (daily bars for detection; daily bars for trend measurement) |
| Zigzag size | 5 bars |
| Zigzag mid size | 2 bars |
| Trend cap days | 30 trading days |
| Direction metric | First confirmed zigzag peak within 30 days (HIGH=follow, LOW=reverse) |
| Command template | `uv run --env-file devenv python -m src.analysis.sign_benchmark --sign SIGN --cluster-set classified2023 --start 2023-04-01 --end 2025-03-31 --gran 1d` |

**Note on granularity**: `--gran 1d` uses daily bars for sign detection. Signs originally designed for
intraday patterns (div_bar, div_vol) fire far fewer times on daily data — their results should be
re-evaluated with `--gran 1h` for a fair comparison.

## Permutation Test & Regime Split (sign_validate)

Run via:
```
uv run --env-file devenv python -m src.analysis.sign_validate \
    --run-ids 22,23,24,25,26,27,28,30,31,33,34
```

**Permutation test**: 2000 iterations simulating H₀ (each event outcome Bernoulli 0.5).  
**Dedup check**: 1 event per stock per 5-day window — inflation ×N shows how many consecutive same-episode fires are in the full count; stable DR means the signal is not a clustering artefact.  
**Regime**: last confirmed N225 zigzag peak (ZZ_SIZE=5) at the fire date. `bear` = last peak was HIGH (N225 declining); `bull` = last peak was LOW (N225 rising).

### Verdict changes from validation

- **`brk_bol` → SKIP**: dedup DR drops to 51.7% (p=0.109). Bull-regime DR = 50.6% (p=0.63) — no edge in 2/3 of all events. The original p=0.044 was entirely driven by bear-regime events and was fragile.
- **`str_lag` → PROVISIONAL with bull gate**: The 1082 bear-regime events have DR=50.2% (no edge). All signal lives in bull regime (N225 in recovery). Gate: only fire when the last confirmed N225 peak was a LOW. This lifts effective DR to 53.6% on n=1247.
- **`rev_nhi` → note added**: No edge in bear regime (DR=51.2%, p=0.47). Only use in bull regime. Already fires mostly in bull (74% of events) so the headline metric is not materially affected.
- **`div_gap` → note added**: 62.6% DR in bear vs 54.1% in bull. Prioritise during N225 bear phases.
- **`str_hold` → confirmed RECOMMEND**: Dedup n=1851 (from 3555), DR rises to 58.1% — the repeat fires actually lower the average. Strong in both regimes.

### Multi-Year Verdict Revisions (FY2018–FY2024)

The 2-year benchmark (classified2023, 2023–2025) coincided with a strong bull market. Cross-FY validation
reveals two signs whose 2-year RECOMMEND was driven by that cycle, not structural edge:

- **`str_lead` → CAUTION**: 2-year DR=59.5% in a sustained bull market (FY2023+FY2024). 7-year pooled
  DR=47.2% — actually a reversal sign in 4 of 7 FYs. perm_pass=3/7 but the passing years (FY2018, FY2024)
  were both strong bull years. In non-bull years (FY2019, FY2020, FY2021, FY2022) DR ranges from 26.6–46.2%.
  **Do not use as a follow-through sign in non-bull N225 environments.**

- **`rev_nhi` → PROVISIONAL (bull-only)**: 2-year DR=54.0% confirmed mostly in bull regime. 7-year pooled
  DR=48.9%, perm_pass=2/7. Bear-regime DR consistently ≤50%; the 2-year RECOMMEND was a regime-selection
  artifact. **Only use in confirmed bull N225 regime; treat as SKIP otherwise.**

- **`rev_nlo` → confirmed SKIP (reversal)**: perm_pass=0/7, pooled_DR=45.4%. Fires as a reversal
  (price goes down after the sign) in most years — the capitulation-bounce thesis is not supported.
  The sign fires at N225 confirmed LOWs but many false bottoms cause the stock to continue falling.

## Corr-Mode Filter Analysis

`--corr-mode high` keeps only events where `|corr(stock, ^N225)| ≥ 0.6` at the fire date.  
`--corr-mode low` keeps only events where `|corr(stock, ^N225)| ≤ 0.3` at the fire date.

### N225-linked signs with `--corr-mode high`

| 40 | div_peer  | 474  |  97 | 57.4 % | 47.8 % | 0.001 | 0.66 | 0.035 | ↓ reverses on low-corr |

### Conclusions

**The corr-mode filter confirms the philosophy for N225-linked signs:**
- `str_hold (high)`: direction_rate 55.4 % → 58.4 %, highly significant. A stock that holds up during a N225 decline is a much stronger signal when it *usually* tracks the index.
- `str_lag (high)`: p improved 0.042 → 0.020, bench_flw jumped to 0.057 (best overall). The delayed-trough thesis requires the stock to be correlated with N225 for the lag to be meaningful.

**Stock-specific signs do NOT improve on low-corr stocks:**
- `div_gap` is actually STRONGEST across all corr regimes — it works *best* when a high-corr stock momentarily breaks from a gapping-down index. Restricting to low-corr stocks cuts the signal.
- `div_peer` and `brk_bol` lose significance entirely on low-corr stocks.
- `rev_lo` and `rev_nhi` are roughly corr-neutral — price-level signals work regardless of index coupling.

**Practical implication:** The corr-mode rule in CLAUDE.md governs **position concentration**, not **signal validity**. You may trade stock-specific signs on any stock, but you must not hold multiple high-corr positions simultaneously. The filter should be applied at portfolio level, not sign level — except for N225-linked signs (str_hold, str_lag) where restricting to high-corr stocks materially improves signal quality.

## Per-Sign Notes

### div_gap (run 22) — **RECOMMEND (FLW)**
- Fires when stock gaps up while N225 gaps down at the session open.
- direction_rate = 58.2 %, p < 0.001, n = 1037 — highest bench_flw of all signs (0.051).
- Logic: overnight buyers chose this stock despite a negative index open; the committed
  positioning creates genuine buying pressure.
- Previously SKIP (short period, p=0.15); the 2-year window confirms the signal is real.
- **Regime split**: DR = 62.6 % in bear regime vs 54.1 % in bull (borderline p=0.062).
  Signal is strongest when N225 is already declining — diverging from a falling index is more meaningful.
- **Use as**: primary long entry on gap-up divergence mornings; prioritise in bear-N225 regime.

### str_lead (run 25) — **RECOMMEND (FLW)**
- Fires when N225 zigzag confirms a LOW and the stock held most of its value during the decline.
- direction_rate = 59.5 %, p < 0.001, n = 405 — highest direction_rate of all signs.
- Logic: relative strength during the decline flags genuine demand; the confirmed N225 bottom
  removes macro headwind.
- **Use as**: primary long entry at confirmed N225 troughs for high-corr stocks.

### rev_lo (run 28) — **RECOMMEND (FLW)**
- Fires when a daily bar tests a prior confirmed zigzag low (within 1.5 % proximity).
- direction_rate = 58.6 %, p < 0.001, n = 1829 — second-highest direction_rate.
- Previously marked FIX (Aug 2024 bias); the 2-year window shows the support-test thesis holds
  over a full market cycle.
- **Use as**: long entry at confirmed support levels; works in trending markets.

### str_hold (run 24/37) — **RECOMMEND (FLW)**
- Fires when the stock outperforms N225 over a rolling 5-day window of N225 decline.
- All stocks: direction_rate = 55.4 %, p < 0.001, n = 3729.
- **High-corr only** (run 37): direction_rate = **58.4 %**, p < 0.001, n = 819 — confirms that a high-corr stock staying flat while N225 falls is a much stronger signal than a chronically-independent stock doing the same.
- **Preferred mode**: `--corr-mode high`; use all-stocks version only as a broad first-pass.
- **Dedup check**: inflation ×1.9 (fires on consecutive days during same N225 decline), but dedup DR *rises* to 58.1 % — the repeat fires lower the average; the underlying signal is stronger than the headline suggests.
- **Regime split**: significant in both bear (54.3 %) and bull (59.3 %) regimes. Bull-regime fires are short corrections within a recovery — also predictive.
- Fires frequently; combine with score threshold (> 0.5) to reduce noise.

### rev_nhi (run 30) — **RECOMMEND (FLW) — bull regime only**
- Fires when a bearish bar touches the prior 20-day high.
- direction_rate = 54.0 %, p < 0.001, n = 3579.
- **Important change from prior benchmark**: previously RECOMMEND (REV) with dr = 42.6 % on
  a short period. Over 2 years, touching a prior high slightly favours follow-through (FLW),
  not reversal. The Aug 2024 crash distorted the earlier result.
- bench_flw = 0.047 is competitive; mag_flw (0.088) is among the best.
- **Regime split**: bull DR = 54.4 % (p < 0.001, n=2471); bear DR = 51.2 % (p = 0.47, n=920) — no
  edge in bear. Breakouts follow through only when the broad trend supports them.
- **Use as**: breakout-confirmation entry in bull-N225 regime; skip in bear regime.

### div_peer (run 33) — **RECOMMEND (FLW)**
- Fires when the stock rises while ≥ 60 % of cluster peers decline on the same day.
- direction_rate = 57.4 %, p = 0.001, n = 474.
- Previously FIX (cluster size = 0 with old settings); fixed by using correct classified2023
  clusters.
- Logic: intra-cluster divergence isolates genuine stock-specific demand.
- **Use as**: low-corr long entry when stock leads its sector peers.

### corr_flip (run 23) — PROVISIONAL (FLW)
- Fires when rolling corr(stock, N225) crosses from negative to positive.
- direction_rate = 56.5 %, p = 0.048, n = 232 — borderline significant with small n.
- bench_flw = 0.057 is the *highest of all signs* despite the small sample.
- **Use as**: watch carefully; accumulate data. Strong when it fires but fires rarely.

### brk_sma (run 26) — PROVISIONAL (FLW)
- direction_rate = 53.2 %, p < 0.001, n = 4800 — significant but weak edge.
- Fires very frequently (avg 29/stock/2yr); the low dr is probably diluted by false breakouts.
- **Recommendation**: add a volume-confirmation filter to raise dr before using.

### brk_bol (run 27) — **SKIP** *(downgraded from PROVISIONAL)*
- direction_rate = 52.0 %, p = 0.044 — barely significant on the full set.
- **Dedup check**: after removing same-stock repeat fires within 5 days (×1.1 inflation),
  dedup DR = 51.7 %, p = 0.109 — loses significance with only light deduplication.
- **Regime split**: bear DR = 54.0 % (p = 0.027); bull DR = 50.6 % (p = 0.63). Two-thirds of
  all events fall in bull regime where there is no edge whatsoever.
- The full-set p=0.044 was entirely driven by bear-regime events; this is too narrow to rely on.
- **Downgraded to SKIP**. Re-evaluate after adding bear-regime gate + volume confirmation.

### str_lag (run 34) — PROVISIONAL (FLW) — bull regime gate required
- Fires when stock makes a daily early low trough 3–7 bars after N225's confirmed low with < 5 % N225 recovery.
- Parameters: `_STOCK_ZZ_SIZE=5`, `_STOCK_ZZ_MID=2`, `_N225_ZZ_SIZE=3`, `LAG_MIN=3`, `LAG_MAX=7`.
- direction_rate = 52.1 %, p ≈ 0.042, n = 2355 — borderline significant.
- bench_flw = 0.051 ties div_gap for highest among all signs; mag_flw = 0.098 is strongest.
- Tightening ZZ_SIZE 3→5 / ZZ_MID 1→2 halved event count (4446 → 2355) and pushed p from 0.59 to 0.042.
- **Regime split (key finding)**: bear DR = 50.2 % (p = 0.876, n=1021) — zero edge. Bull DR = 53.6 % (p = 0.010, n=1247) — all the signal lives in bull regime. The bear-regime fires occur when a prior N225 HIGH was the last confirmed peak; the stock lag may be following the index down rather than lagging a recovery.
- **Gate required**: only fire when the last confirmed N225 zigzag peak was a LOW (bull regime). This halves the event pool but eliminates the dead-weight bear events entirely.
- Dedup check: inflation ×1.0 (no clustering) — the signal is not a clustering artefact.

### corr_shift (run 32) — SKIP
- direction_rate = 51.6 %, p = 0.19 — no significant edge over 2 years.
- Previously RECOMMEND (REV) on 11-month period; the 2023 bull market dilutes the
  bear-regime effect. The sign is regime-conditional and needs a bear-N225 gate.
- **Recommendation**: re-evaluate with `--start 2024-01-01` (post-peak) or add
  N225 downtrend filter.

### rev_nlo (run 31) — SKIP
- direction_rate = 52.7 %, p = 0.10 — not significant.
- Fires when N225 zigzag confirms a LOW and the stock underperformed during the decline
  (capitulation bounce thesis). The capitulation thesis fires rarely in bull markets.
- n = 907 over 2 years; too few confirmed N225 troughs in a bull-market-dominant period.

### rev_hi (run 29) — SKIP
- direction_rate = 50.5 %, p = 0.64 — essentially random.
- Testing prior highs carries no predictive edge at this granularity.

### corr_shift (run 32) — SKIP
- See note above.

### div_bar (run 20) & div_vol (run 21) — SKIP (n too small)
- These fire on intraday bar patterns (1h candle vs N225); on daily data they are nearly
  inactive (17 and 12 events respectively). Re-run with `--gran 1h` for a fair benchmark.

### corr_peak — NOT RUN
- Requires `PeakCorrRun` DB table to be populated first.
- Run `uv run --env-file devenv python -m src.analysis.peak_corr` then re-run benchmark.

## Watchlist Recommendations

| Priority | Sign | Direction | Rationale |
|----------|------|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | div_gap  | Follow | Highest bench_flw; highly significant; clear overnight-conviction logic |
| 1 | str_lead | Follow | Highest direction_rate; highly significant; N225 trough + relative strength |
| 1 | rev_lo   | Follow | Highly significant; confirmed support-test follow-through |
| 2 | str_hold | Follow | Large sample; highly significant; moderate edge; needs score gate |
| 2 | rev_nhi  | Follow | Highly significant; breakout-confirmation on 20-day high |
| 2 | div_peer | Follow | Significant; intra-cluster divergence isolates genuine alpha |
| Watch | corr_flip | Follow | emp_p=0.022; n=232 too small for per-regime significance; slight bull preference |
| Watch | str_lag  | Follow | Bull-regime only (gate required); dedup stable; needs corr gate |
| Watch | corr_shift | Regime-gated | No edge over full cycle; may work in bear-N225 regime only |
| Rework | div_bar / div_vol | — | Re-run with --gran 1h for fair evaluation |
| Rework | corr_peak | — | Populate PeakCorrRun DB first |
| Rework | brk_bol | — | Add bear-regime gate + volume confirmation before re-evaluating |

## Signs Requiring Rework

| Sign | Issue | Suggested Fix |
|------|-------|--------------|
| str_lag | Bull-regime only (bear DR=50.2%); still borderline overall | Add bull-N225-regime gate (last confirmed N225 peak = LOW) |
| brk_bol | No edge in bull regime (2/3 of events); dedup p=0.109 | Add bear-regime gate + volume confirmation; re-benchmark |
| div_bar / div_vol | Nearly no events on 1d gran | Re-benchmark with `--gran 1h` |
| corr_peak | PeakCorrRun not populated | Run peak_corr analysis over classified2023 members |
| corr_shift | Regime-conditional | Add N225 downtrend filter (e.g. N225 < 50-day SMA) |

**Notes on interpretation**
- pooled_DR% is n-weighted across all FYs; p_pooled is the binomial test on the pooled n.
- perm_pass = FYs where the permutation test passes at p<0.05.
- bear_DR / bull_DR ranges show min–max across FYs.
- Signs consistent across multiple FYs with perm_pass ≥ 4/7 are the most reliable.

## Regime-Split Analysis: ADX + Ichimoku Kumo

Generated: 2026-05-18
Indicators computed on ^N225 daily bars.
ADX window=14; Ichimoku: tenkan=9, kijun=26, senkou_b=52 (cloud shift=26).
Events: multi-year runs (FY2018–FY2024, run_ids≥47).
p: two-sided binomial vs H₀=50%.  vs_all: pooled DR for that sign across all regimes.
mag_flw / mag_rev: mean trend_magnitude on follow / reverse events in this regime.
EV = DR × mag_flw − (1−DR) × mag_rev — the regime-conditional expected return per trade.
mag_flw / mag_rev / EV are masked ("—") unless the cell passes both:
  - p < 0.05  (the direction rate is not just noise)
  - min(n_flw, n_rev) ≥ 10  (each magnitude average is reliable)

### ADX Regime Split

ADX regime states:
- **choppy** (ADX < 20): no trending momentum — index oscillating, no directional bias
- **bull** (ADX ≥ 20, +DI > −DI): uptrend with momentum
- **bear** (ADX ≥ 20, +DI ≤ −DI): downtrend with momentum

## Score Calibration: Does sign_score Predict Outcomes?

Generated: 2026-05-18  
Events: multi-year runs (FY2018–FY2024, run_ids ≥ 47).  
signed_return = trend_direction × trend_magnitude (+ when sign follows, − when reverses).  
ρ: Spearman correlation between sign_score and signed_return.  
Per-quartile rows with n < 50 are shown but their stats are masked.

### Quartile Breakdown

DR = direction-rate; mag_flw / mag_rev = mean trend_magnitude when the trend follows / reverses;
EV = DR × mag_flw − (1−DR) × mag_rev (expected return per trade in that quartile).
If the score is informative we expect EV(Q4) ≫ EV(Q1).

| Sign | Quartile | score range | n | DR% | mag_flw | mag_rev | EV |

## Sign Score Calibration by Regime

Generated: 2026-05-18  
Events: multi-year runs (FY2018–FY2024, run_ids ≥ 47).  
corr_mode tagged per event via 20-bar returns-corr to ^N225 (high ≥ 0.6, low ≤ 0.3, mid in between).  
Only (sign, corr_mode) cells with n ≥ 200 are tabulated.  
q = Benjamini–Hochberg FDR across listed cells.  
ρ_loo_min / ρ_loo_max: ρ recomputed leaving one FY out, worst / best.  
flips: FYs where leave-one-out ρ has the opposite sign vs full-sample ρ.  
monotone: quartile EV ordering (asc = Q1<Q2<Q3<Q4, desc = reverse, no = neither).  
Verdict gates: strong = n≥1000 ∧ |ρ|≥0.05 ∧ p<0.05 ∧ q<0.05 ∧ monotone ∧ 0 flips;  
moderate = n≥200 ∧ |ρ|≥0.10 ∧ p<0.01 ∧ q<0.05 ∧ monotone ∧ 0 flips.

### Sign Summary: All Events vs Regime-Accepted Events

Regime-accepted = (sign, kumo) cell present in training ranking AND ADX veto passes.  
regime_n% = fraction of total events retained by the regime filter.

**Interpretation**: Positive Δ DR means the Kumo+ADX regime filter selected
events with better follow-through outcomes in the out-of-sample year.
Low regime_n% indicates the filter is aggressive; verify test_n is large enough.
